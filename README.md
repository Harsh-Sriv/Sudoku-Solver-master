# Sudoku Solver ðŸ§©

## Overview
A fast and efficient Sudoku solver implemented in C++ that uses backtracking algorithm to solve any valid Sudoku puzzle. The program can solve even the most challenging puzzles within milliseconds.

## Features
### Core Functionality
- **Fast Solving Algorithm** âš¡
  - Implements optimized backtracking algorithm
  - Solves most puzzles in under 1ms
  - Handles multiple puzzle difficulties

### Input/Output
- **Flexible Input Methods**
  - File input (.txt format)
  - Command-line input
  - Hard-coded puzzles
- **Clear Output Format**
  - Formatted grid display
  - Step-by-step solution visualization (optional)
  - Solving time statistics

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (GCC/G++ 5.0 or higher)
- CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
- Make

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sudoku-solver.git
```

2. Navigate to project directory
```bash
cd sudoku-solver
```

3. Build the project
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Usage

### Command Line Input
```bash
./sudoku_solver
```
Then enter your Sudoku puzzle row by row, using 0 or . for empty cells:
```
5 3 0 0 7 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 1 9 5 0 0 0
0 9 8 0 0 0 0 6 0
...
```

### File Input
```bash
./sudoku_solver -f path/to/puzzle.txt
```

### Example Input File Format
```
5 3 0 0 7 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 1 9 5 0 0 0
0 9 8 0 0 0 0 6 0
8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 3
4 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 1
7 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 6
0 6 0 0 0 0 2 8 0
0 0 0 4 1 9 0 0 5
0 0 0 0 8 0 0 7 9
```

## How It Works

### Algorithm
The solver uses a backtracking algorithm with the following optimizations:
1. Forward checking
2. Minimum remaining values heuristic
3. Constraint propagation

### Time Complexity
- Worst case: O(9^(n*n))
- Average case: Much faster due to optimizations
